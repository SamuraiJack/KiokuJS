Collapsing  - reducing an object into DB entry
Expanding   - the reverse of collapsing, DB Entry => Object


DESIGN DECISIONS
================

- Only store Joose instances, because how we can determine the meta-data for arbitrary JS class anyway? we need URL for module and class constructor to 'expand' the objects
