TASKS
=====
 
- speed up Data.Visitor as much as possible (remove too detailed visits, like object key, etc) 
  may be switch it to JooseX.Proto.Class? (needs to be benchmarked first)

- serialization of dates (test)
- deserialization tests

- KiokuJS.Serializer.JSON.BuiltIn (JSON.stringify)

- remove `typeMap' attr from Node (seems only required in `aquireId` and can be passed to it)


DONE
====

- harmonize approach to Data.Visitor subclassing across whole system
