TASKS
=====
 
- speed up Data.Visitor as much as possible (remove too detailed visits, like object key, etc) (required for JSON?)
  may be switch it to JooseX.Proto.Class? (needs to be benchmarked first)

- serialization of dates (test)
- deserialization tests
- serialization of `undefined` (currently as null)

- KiokuJS.Serializer.JSON.BuiltIn (JSON.stringify)


- scope...

- versioning

- sanitize exceptions (add additional meaningful properties, like `id` where appropriate) 


DONE
====

- KiokuJS.Test.Fixture - a set of tests fixtures to run with different backends
- harmonize approach to Data.Visitor subclassing across whole system
